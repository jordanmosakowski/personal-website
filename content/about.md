Hello! My name is Jordan Mosakowski, and I am a student originally from Boulder, Colorado. I am currently a senior at Santa Clara University, studying Computer Science and Engineering with minors in Mathematics and Electrical and Computer Engineering. I also run the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) at Santa Clara, which hosts several events a week ranging from workshops to guest speakrs to hackathons.

I have held a number of internships during my high school and college career. Most recently, I interned at Amazon, where I developed a new service for the Amazon One team. Before that, I was a software engineer at INRIX, where I added features to one of their tools that helps local governments improve traffic flow. Lastly, I spent three summers at Lockheed Martin, where I worked on a variety of projects that touched on virtual reality, robotics, and full stack web development.

In my free time, you can find me working on personal programming projects, watching Formula 1, or attending concerts.
