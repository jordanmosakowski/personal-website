In a team of 3, I developed a robot to navigate a course and perform a variety of tasks, including playing whack-a-mole. The robot was built around an Arduino Mega microcontroller, and utilized several motors, servos, and sensors. The software package included a custom path following, line following, and positional tracking systems I wrote from scratch. Our robot placed 3rd in the final competition.
