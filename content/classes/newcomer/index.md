I worked with Conner Yin on a senior design project to help employees make stronger connections with their coworkers. Our project was ranked as the top project in our session at the 54th annual Santa Clara University School of Engineering Senior Design Conference in May 2024.

In the evolving landscape of remote and hybrid work, new employees and interns often struggle with isolation and find it challenging to build meaningful connections within their companies. Traditional professional networking platforms and communication tools do not adequately support casual, personal interactions that are essential for fostering a welcoming and integrated workplace culture.

Newcomer tackles this issue head on by providing people a way to interact with their coworkers through groups centered around common interests. Groups of employees can chat about their hobbies and interests, and then schedule activities or events to help foster in person connections as well. Our Flutter frontend allows this application to be used on your phone, web browser, or desktop. Using two custom machine learning models in Python and running on Firebase, we are able to match users and their interests to groups and other users to encourage even more interactions.
