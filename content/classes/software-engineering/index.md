Over the course of 10 weeks, we created a full stack web application that allows groups to plan trips together. Using several APIs to integrate directly with important services like airlines, hotels, rental cars, and event providers like Ticketmaster, our application serves as an all-in-one travel application for any group looking to travel together. Designed in Flutter, the app is cross platform as an iOS app, Android app, and Progressive Web App.

Features:
- Flight search powered by Amadeus GDS
- Hotel search powered by Amadeus GDS
- Restaurant search powered by Yelp
- Rental car search powered by Skyscanner
- Activities search powered by Ticketmaster
- Map view
- Checkout via Stripe
- Export itinerary to PDF and Google Calendar
- Feedback and comments between group members
