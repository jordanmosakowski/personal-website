Engineers Without Borders is an organization with a mission to help communites in need through engineering projects. Santa Clara's chapter of EWB has an ongoing 9-year relationship with a community in Nyange, Rwanda. Over the course of our long-term partnership, EWB-SCU has used our engineering and technical skills to provide the community with deliverables that increase the efficiency of the tile making process and a secure and sustainable drinking-water system that can filter for bacteria, parasites, turbidity, and nitrates, and control water distribution.

EWB-SCU also partners with Valley Verde, a non-profit in San Jose, California. We are currently designing and constructing a germination chamber to help with initial plant growth during the winter season.
