I was an intern on the Amazon One team. Amazon One is a new identity service that work by reading user's palms. It can currently be found in many grocery stores, concert halls, and other venues that require payment, identity, or entry. At Amazon One, I developed a new microservice. I was responsible for setting up the infracture, writing tests, and overseeing the deployment of the service.
