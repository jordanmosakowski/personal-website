During 3-month internship, I developed multiple production features for Signal Analytics, INRIX's SaaS tool to help engineers to improve traffic flow. My first project involved upgrading the team's email delivery service to allow traffic engineers to view weekly and monthly reports about problematic intersections and corridors. I also added GraphQL API endpoints and implemented a user interface to display Intersection Trajectory Plots. This feature was highlighted at ITS World Congress and covered in an INRIX press release, which can be viewed [here](https://inrXix.com/press-releases/signal-analytics-trajectory-plots/)
