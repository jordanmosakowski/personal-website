JetStream provides a seamless end-to-end experience to plan entire business trips. We then take you to our main display, which includes the trip itinerary and a side panel for selecting transport options, all overlaid on a beautiful, interactive map. After selecting each option, the map view and routes will be automatically updated based on the leg of the trip. Once everything is complete, the trip itinerary with total cost and time breakdowns is available.

I developed all major UI components besides the map, and parsed all of the API data into a consistent format that can be easily digested by the frontend.
