Developed web application for helping SCU students plan their schedule in a more intuitive way. The application was initially developed by accessing SCU's CourseAvail API with the frontend built in Angular. However, when SCU switched to using the Workday platform in 2023, the app was rewritten in Flutter with more features that weren't present in Workday, with cloud syncing powered by Firebase.
